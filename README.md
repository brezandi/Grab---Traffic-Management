# Grab---Traffic-Management
Grab AI Challenge for SEA  
The rule :  
In this challenge, participants are to build a model trained on a historical demand dataset, that can forecast demand on a Hold-out test dataset. The model should be able to accurately forecast ahead by T+1 to T+5 time intervals (where each interval is 15-min) given all data up to time T.  

You can use the "Demand Data" dataset provided by Grab.  

You are expected to create a Data Model based on the "Demand Data" dataset in order to solve the given problem statement.  

You should also provide step by step documentation on how to run your code. Our evaluators will be running your data models on a test dataset.
